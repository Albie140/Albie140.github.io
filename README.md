# My Portfolio

In my Portfolio, you will learn a bit more about me and my future goals. My responsive portfolio features 3 tabs: About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Me. My Porfoilio currently houses placeholder images. Since, I just began this class, I do not have any projects or homework to add to it. The Contact Me page also features a link to my Linkedin profile, for easy connecting. I look forward to updating this Portfolio as I continue through my coding journey.
